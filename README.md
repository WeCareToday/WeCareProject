Team Members Jennifer Sung Ryan Gosselin Kyle Knight Juan Olmedo


## Vision

We are creating an Android app that functions as a tool to help people/families/organizations exchange or donate foods to people in need and prevent food waste. 


You should care because food insecurity is a real issue and food waste is also a problem in this country! 

## Scope (In/Out)


**Out of Scope**
* This app doesn't act as a payment portal
* This app will only be developed with Java and Android, as a app
* This app will also not be collecting discrete demographic data

**Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Definition**: The MVP of WeShare app will include the following core features:
* User/Organization is able to create an account
* Person donating can find organization/person to give food to
* A list of food can be generated to offer the person
* A person/organization is able to mark the food as either delivered or not delivered
* Once the delivery is done the donator will get 'points' for his/her donation


**STRETCH GOALS**:
* In or Out Status
* Chat System: So users can private message other users.
* Dashboard and Notifications: Design a user-friendly dashboard where users can see all pending donations requests.
